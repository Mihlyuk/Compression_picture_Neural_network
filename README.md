Recycling network - compression picture
============

A graph of the number of iterations of compression ratio
--------------
The following input parameters were set to determine this relationship:
 - 256x256 size image;
 - Squares of the same image size 4x4;
 - The maximum permissible errors - in 1000.
 
Changing the compression ratio is achieved by varying the number of hidden layer neurons.

Compression coefficient | asdasd | asdsad
--- | --- | ---
asdasd | asdasda | asdasda
1 | 123 | 123
